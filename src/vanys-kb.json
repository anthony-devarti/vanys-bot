Inside the walls, the smell of bread, smoke, and sea-salt creates a sense of calm that feels almost unnatural given how close the wild truly is. The streets are small but orderly, filled with the noise of hammers, gossip, and the comfortable routines of people who know danger waits just beyond the boundary. Outside the gates the trees close in, the air turns cold, and the land feels old and watchful. Farhearth endures because it must, a lone pocket of warmth pressed against the edge of an endless, indifferent frontier.",
